# Basic-NLP-Example
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the basics of foundational NLP work. It will demonstrate implementation of text preprocessing techniques, text to numerical encoding methods, and classification functions using two datasets:

The first source dataset is from the Clickbait Dataset(1) that has article headlines and a binary label indicating whether the headline is considered clickbait (1) or not (0).
The second source dataset is from the Web of Science Dataset(2) that has articles labeled with the topics of the articles.

The data will need to be cleaned using text preprocessing techniques, and run through the numerical encoding methods. Once the text is numerically encoded, the encoded values will go into the classification functions and the labels will be predicted. Once thisis complete, evaluation metrics will be needed to analyze how the classifiers perform.
